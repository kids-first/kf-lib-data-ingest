-- Ambiguous Data --
An attribute of a child concept is attached to a parent concept
Example:
- Participant P1 has biospecimen B1, B2
- Property BIOSPECIMEN.TISSUE_TYPE.Blood is attached to P1


-- Invalid Data --
A child concept is connected to more than one parent concept
BIOSPECIMEN is connected to more than one [PARTICIPANT, PARTICIPANT-predecessors]
This should not be allowed and should raise an exception

-- Identifier Properties --
Any child concept can unambiguously identify a parent concept

-- Building Edges --
For ID Nodes:
    Collect ID nodes in a row
    Iterate over ID nodes pairwise
    Check graph - does a path exist from A to B already?
    - Yes - do nothing
    - No - Create an undirected edge from A to B
For property nodes:
    If the concept for this property exists in the row, attach it there
    else attach it to its nearest child concept (?)
    ** This requires us to enforce relationships on standard model

-- Restrictions --
- We need to know which concept connections could create undesirable
connections.
Example: Family can connect 1 or more participants and/or participant
child concepts.

When searching for a property, P of concept C1:
Do BFS in search for P:
    For neighbor in all neighbors of C1:
        Evaluate whether to add neighbor to list of nodes to traverse:
            Is neighbor a parent of C1 and is there a restriction for it?
                No - it is valid
                Yes - check whether it is valid
                    If neighbor is connected to any other nodes in the set
                    [C, C-descendants (children)] the neighbor is invalid
                    else the neighbor is valid

Example:
Search for property PARTICIPANT.AGE.30 of participant P1.
Do BFS in search of PARTICIPANT.AGE.30:
    For neighbor in all neighbors of P1:
        Is neighbor concept any of participant's parent concepts [Family]:
            No - it is valid
            Yes - check whether it is valid
                If neighbor is connected to any other nodes in the set
                [P, P-descendants (children)] the neighbor is invalid
                else the neighbor is valid
