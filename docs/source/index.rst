Kids First Data Ingest Lib Docs
===============================

Overview
^^^^^^^^
The Kids First Data Ingest Library standardizes the transformation and
ingestion of Kids First raw study data into target Kids First services.

A CLI wraps the library and is the primary user interface for
using the ingestion pipeline. Users will use the CLI to ingest Kids First studies
into the Kids First Data Service which is the only supported target service at this point.
