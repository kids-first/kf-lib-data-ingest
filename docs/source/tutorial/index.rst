Tutorial
========

The quickstart example uses a simple dataset and is primarily intended to show
a user how to run the ingest pipeline and view basic outputs. This tutorial
will use a more complex study dataset and step through each ingest stage in
much more depth.

In this tutorial we will cover:

1. How to configure complex extractions with multiple messy source data files
2. How to write a transform function for the transform stage
3. How to run the ingest pipeline from end to end
4. How to debug steps 1 through 3 by:

   - Running stages individually
   - Viewing stage outputs
   - Viewing ingest logs
