Tutorial
===========

The quickstart example uses a simple dataset and is primarily intended to show a user how to run the ingest pipeline and view basic outputs.
This tutorial will use a more complex study dataset and step through each ingest stage in much more depth.

In this tutorial we will cover:

1. How to configure a complex study for the extract stage:

    - i.e. multiple messy source data files
2. How to write a transform function for the transform stage
3. How to run the ingest pipeline from end to end
4. How to debug during steps 1 thru 3 by:

    - Running stages individually
    - Viewing stage outputs
    - Viewing ingest logs
